The names are translated from Chinese at the best of my knowledge, since some are nicknames presumably by Team Cherry themselves, i was not able to find a 1 to 1, but i'm pretty sure 95% of them are correct. Also the actual name you will find will be "GotSilkSpear" or "GotFaydownCloak" something like that. The name on the left is the nickname as reported in the dat files. Everytime you reach these "milestones" the game saves and stores them, up to, i believe 21. This is crucial for planning the speedrunning or steel soul achievments, because you can reset the time played (if you wasted 2 hours on high halls for example, restore the previous one without restarting the game).
